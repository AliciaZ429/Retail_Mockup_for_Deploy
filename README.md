# Retail-Sales-Mockup

# Introduction

This is a data visualization mockup of retail sales data of 207. It has a retail line chart and a seasonal percentage pie chart. In addition, a fact table.

# Known Issue

Tried migrating to TS in dev branch, TS failed to launch very likely because of ts-node compatability. Chose to touch up visualization due to time limit. Check out dev it needed.
